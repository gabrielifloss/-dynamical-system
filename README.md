# Dynamical Systems
This repository is a study resource of a Math Course offered by my college: 'Introduction to Dynamical Systems'.

The main goal of this course is to give an overview about Dynamic Systems and how we use it in our modern world. During the class, I was wondering about an algorythm to translate the math knowledge and simulations about it.
